# maven-project
Source code for DevOps Training. Triggering Automatically.
Multiple job example - CICD
Triggered cron job, building job, check code quality and creating war. 
Also, since SSH authentication is enabled for my Git Repo, have to provide Git SSH credentials while adding git repo via 'Configure' in any job.
